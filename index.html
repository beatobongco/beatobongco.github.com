    <h1>Beato Bongco</h1>
    <h3>Full-stack Natural Language Processing and Web Engineering</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Beato and I’ve been building software for the last 10 years,
      mostly in Python and Javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
      I worked as a senior product engineer building natural language systems at
      Thinking Machines for 2 years and a senior full-stack web engineer + head
      of UI and operations at Insync for 5 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve researched, prototyped, built, improved and deployed machine learning
      models, frontend applications and backend web systems to production.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've worked extensively with technologies like Flask, FastAPI, Django,
      React, Vue, Pytorch, Keras, and Docker but I'm always willing to learn new
      things in a jiffy.
    </p>

    <h3>Hire me!</h3>

    <p>
      I’d like to help build natural language processing systems for your
      company, as well as any surrounding systems it may require like a webapp,
      a user interface, an API, data ingestion scripts, model retraining
      pipelines and more.
    </p>

    <h3>What is natural language processing?</h3>

    <p>
      Natural language processing (NLProc) helps computers understand and
      process large volumes of unstructured documents like articles on the web,
      emails, documents in the cloud or on your computer. With NLProc you can do
      interesting things like put a tag on specific kinds of documents, find
      similar ones, summarize them, know their sentiment, extract insights,
      improve search by matching more than keywords, generate text, and automate
      business processes.
    </p>

    <p>Here are a few examples of what NLProc can do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Research organization? Find topics of interest in patient records /
        research papers / legal reports, connect related documents, or create a
        search engine to help your knowledge workers find breakthroughs faster
      </li>
      <li>
        Investment organization? If you’re scraping large amounts of data from
        the web for trading signals you’ll want to filter the signal from the
        noise. You’ll also want to know if people are bullish or bearish with
        sentiment analysis
      </li>
      <li>
        E-commerce website? Help users find better content by correctly
        understanding their search intent and finding products related to what
        they’ve been looking at
      </li>
      <li>
        Drowning in email from customers? Automatically route incoming emails /
        support tickets to the correct team or find recurring requests so you
        know what to prioritize
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I excel at finding solutions and prototyping them rapidly but I can also
      make them production ready.
    </p>
