      <h3>Full-stack Natural Language Processing and Web Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Beato and I’ve been building software for the last 10 years,
        mostly in Python and Javascript.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am deeply interested in artificial intelligence and user interfaces
        (see: <a href="https://beatobongco.com/UI-Kata/">toy projects</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked as a senior product engineer building natural language systems
        for international clients at
        <a href="https://thinkingmachin.es/">Thinking Machines</a> for 2 years
        and as a senior full-stack web engineer + head of UI and operations at
        <a href="https://www.insynchq.com/">Insync</a> for 5 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also been consulting for businesses since I was in my junior year
        in university.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve researched, prototyped, built, improved, and deployed machine
        learning models, frontend applications, and backend web systems to
        production.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've worked extensively with technologies like Flask, FastAPI, Django,
        React, Vue, Elasticsearch, Pytorch, Keras, and Docker but I'm always
        willing to learn new things in a jiffy.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        I’d like to help build natural language processing or information
        retrieval systems for your company, as well as any surrounding systems
        it may require like a webapp, a user interface, an API, data ingestion
        scripts, model retraining pipelines and more.
      </p>

      <h3>What is natural language processing?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Natural language processing (NLProc)</strong> helps computers
        understand and process large volumes of unstructured documents like
        articles on the web, emails, documents in the cloud or on your computer.
        With NLProc you can do interesting things like put a tag on specific
        kinds of documents, find documents relevant to your intent, summarize
        them, know their sentiment, extract insights, improve search by matching
        more than keywords, generate text, and automate business processes.
      </p>

      <p>Here are a few examples of what NLProc can do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Research organization? Find topics of interest in patient records /
          research papers / legal reports, connect related documents, or create
          a search engine to help your knowledge workers find breakthroughs
          faster
        </li>
        <li>
          Investment organization? If you’re scraping large amounts of data from
          the web for trading signals you’ll want to filter the signal from the
          noise. You’ll also want to know if people are bullish or bearish with
          sentiment analysis
        </li>
        <li>
          E-commerce website? Help users find better content by correctly
          understanding their search intent and finding products related to what
          they’ve been looking at
        </li>
        <li>
          Drowning in email from customers? Automatically route incoming emails
          / support tickets to the correct team or find recurring requests so
          you know what to prioritize
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I excel at finding solutions and prototyping them rapidly but I can also
        make them production ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Want to do cool things with your company's documents or unstructured
        data?
